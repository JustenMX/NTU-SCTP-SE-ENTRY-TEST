# NTU-SCTP-SE-ENTRY-TEST

This repository contains the solutions to the NTU SCTP Software Engineering entry test questions. The questions and the solutions can be found in the assets folder in the respective .js files.

To showcase my entry level programming skills, I decided to create a React frontend to display the questions and solutions. The website can be accessed by running the command <span style="color:red">npm run dev</span> after installing the dependencies with <span style="color:red">npm install.</span> Alternatively you can visit the site at <a href="https://ntu-sctp-se-entry-test.vercel.app/">Vercel</a>

<blockquote>I also wanted to highlight that I have a lot to learn, but I am eager to improve and showcase my competency.
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.</blockquote>
